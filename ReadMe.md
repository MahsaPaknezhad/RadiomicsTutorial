# Tree Bark Identification Using Radiomics 
Since the term radiomics was first coined in 2012, it has widely been used for medical image analysis. Radiomics is a method that automatically extracts a large of number of different features from medical images. These features have been able to uncover characteristics that can differentiate tumoral tissue from normal tissue or tissue at different stages of cancer.

In this repository, we would like to show that radiomic features can be useful for analysis of images in other domains as well. As a example, we show that radiomic features can be used for tree bark identification. We use the publicly available dataset of tree bark images [here](https://www.vicos.si/resources/trunk12/). All the code is provided in the notebook file: ```tree_bark_analysis.ipynb```

We have compared our results with those of a published paper [Boudra et al, 2018] on this dataset which uses a different texture descriptor for classification of tree barks.
